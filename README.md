# 🔁 Palidrome Checker
This is a simple project that checks whether a word or phrase is a **palindrome**. A palindrome is a word or phrase that can be read the same way forwards and backwards, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

## 💡 How It Works
1. The user enters a word or phrase.
2. The program removes spaces and non-alphanumeric characters, and converts it to lowercase.
3. It compares the cleaned string to its reverse.
4. Displays whether it is a palindrome.
Examples:
- **"madam"**
- **"racecar"**
- **"A man a plan a canal Panama"**
